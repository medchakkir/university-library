# University Library Implementation

This document tracks the implementation progress of improvements for the University Library project. Tasks are organized by category and should be completed in the order presented when possible.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Replace useMemo with useEffect in SearchBook component (lines 61-63) for proper side effect handling
- [x] Remove duplicate file: `SimilarBooks.tsx~` (Found and removed `page.tsx~` in app/(auth)/sign-up directory)
- [x] Fix typo in component filename: Rename `SeachBook.tsx` to `SearchBook.tsx` and update all imports (Note: The file was already correctly named SearchBook.tsx, no action needed)
- [x] Add proper TypeScript typing for all components (define interfaces for props and state)
- [x] Implement consistent error handling across all server actions

## In Progress Tasks
